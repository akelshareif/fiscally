# Dev Notes

-   You will move the models, forms, and tests into each blueprint
-   The app.py will serve as a single route where the main home page of the application resides
-   Setup heroku after db models are created and deploy application to prevent tougher debugging later on
-   The root directory's templates folder will hold the base.jinja file as well as other jinja snippet files for global usage

## Design Notes

-   You will need to add a favicon to the application
-   You will design a logo for the application
-   You will figure out a consistent color scheme and may actually have a global css file
